        <article class="container">
            <p class="text">
                Hey! My name is Will Taylor. I grew up in Spokane, Washington, and I’m currently studying at the
                University of Washington. Along with that, I am a co-founder of
                and general manager for Flinch eSports, which is a StarCraft II team and eSports organization
                based in Australia.
            <p class="text">
                As to Flinch, I have been a professional StarCraft II player since 2013. After coming to college,
                I realized that I no longer had the time to dedicate to specifically competing.
                So, I instead took everything I had learned from competing and turned it to
                creating an organization to (ideally) bolster the global StarCraft scene, to
                facilitate other players continued ability to make a career out of professional play, and to
                act as a part of professional StarCraft's platform.
            </p>
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                With that in mind, I’m intending to study Computer Science with a focus
                in either Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence or data sciences,
                and am currently looking to expand my work experience in the general programming field.
            </p>
