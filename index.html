        <article class="container">
            <p class="text">
            	Hey! My name is Will Taylor. I grew up in Spokane, Washington, and Iâ€™m a Software Engineer currently based
                in Seattle, Washington. I have a degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Sciences from the
                University of Washington: Seattle, and graduated in March of 2021.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Along with that, I am a former StarCraft II player, coach, captain, etc. for Rise eSports, an
                international eSports organization active from 2015-2020, as well as having been heavily involved in its founding.
                Ironically, my time competing in StarCraft II is actually how I found myself pursuing a career in
                software engineering in the first place. I found that my interest in StarCraft was actually in on-the-fly
                problem solving and predicting behavior, which aligns itself very well with engineering.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                So far as my career in engineering is concerned, my aspirations lean towards security and/or system
                architecture. I'm constantly looking to challenge myself; to learn more about the field and find ways
                to increase my impact wherever I'm working, whatever I'm working on. I love to build things, and I love
                to solve problems.

            </p>
